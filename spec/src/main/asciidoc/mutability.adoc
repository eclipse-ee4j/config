= Mutability

Certain config sources support mutation of values in time.


Examples of sources that can change values (mutable in following text):
- File config sources (file overwritten)
- Database config sources
- System properties (property changed)

Examples of sources that cannot change values (immutable in following text):
- Classpath config sources (classpath resources are loaded once)
- Environment variables

When a mutable config source "mutates", we have the following options:

- ignore the change and use initial values (switching to immutable behavior)
- accept the change and modify configuration state (details below)

== Scope

=== Goals

- define behavior for mutable config sources
- define SPI to allow notification of a change in a config source
- define API to allow notification of a change in config tree
- define ways to disable mutability features for a specific source

=== Non-goals

- prescribe mutability support for any config source
- define strategies for change discovery (polling, events)


== Specification

=== Behavior of mutable config sources

When config reads the first value from a mutable config source, the config source must ensure that all subsequent values obtained from this source are from the same version of the source.

In case the config source cannot ensure such behavior, behavior will be undefined and atomicity of configuration would be compromised.

Examples:
- File source could read the whole file, and serve values from memory
- System properties source could create a copy of the map and serve values from the copy

TODO: we may switch to support reading multiple values from a source at once, which would relax this a bit, but increase complexity of other features

TCK:
- if file config source is required by spec (e.g. to read jakarta-config.properties from current dir), validate that change to the file will not result in the config changing
- use system properties config source and validate that a changed system property will not result in the config changing
- use a custom mutable config source and validate that change will not result in the config changing and that a change would trigger the required events

=== SPI

A config source provides information about its mutability support through an SPI method `ConfigSource.isMutable()`.
See javadoc for details.

This method exists for optimization of configuration tree, where the config implementation can differentiate sources that are immutable (and in case all sources are immutable, it can use a single tree with no change support).

In addition, for mutable config sources, the method `ConfigSource.onChange(Consumer<Map<String, String>> changedNodesConsumer)` would be called by config implementation to receive mutations.

TODO: we may switch from Map to a TreeNode API once we finalize tree support in config sources (and if we decide to use tree structure instead of flat structure on config source SPI).

=== API

Config provides change support to user through method `Config.onChange(Consumer<Config> changeConsumer)`.

The config implementation must call the method with updated values provided from the mutated config source.
The config implementation must invoke such methods only after all changed keys from a config source are processed (to provide atomicity of changes as long as they come from a single config source).

The config implementation must compare the whole (known) tree for changes, to ensure references are correctly notified as well (in case user listens on changes for `server.host` that has value set to `${my-host}` and key `my-host` is modified, change listeners for `server.host` must be triggered).

```
   Config server = config.get("server");
   server.onChange(it -> changeServer(it));
```

When in an environment that supports injection and managed beans (such as CDI), the behavior of the `onChange` method is undefined and may have unexpected side effects.
Other means of delivering events should be used in such environments (will be specified in CDI integration section of Config specification).

TODO: add a section to CDI integration:
- we need a new event - this must be defined in a way that will NOT introduce dependency on CDI specification - programmatic API is forbidden in CDI for change handling (implications on threads used, and problematic lifecycle of beans, e.g. when `@RequestScoped` bean would call method
`onChange`, it would be delivered outside of the scope

=== Controlling mutability of a source

The following configuration keys must be honored by mutable sources if defined in that source:

- `jakarta.config.mutable`, boolean - if set to `false`, this source must be immutable even if the `ConfigSource` supports mutability; setting value to `true` should have no impact on `ConifgSource` behavior (e.g. if it is mutable, the result would be mutable, if it is immutable, the result would still be immutable)
